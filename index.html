<p>My interest in Information Technology started back in the late 90's where I began studying a "Diploma of Computer Systems" at Boxhill Tafe. Although most of the
   course was quite basic I began looking for fulltime employment in the final stages of the course and I started an Electrical Apprenticeship at Ford Motor Company
    early 2002, whilst working through out my apprenticeship and as an Industrial Electrician I worked in  many IT related projects to improve maintenance of facilities
     and improving Manufacturing performance

   I would be involved in network security at the highest level. I realise when I see this opportunity as a requirement of 8 yrs networking experience is
    required and 3 years of security experience I will be required to work in the IT industry for many many years to get to this elite level.I do have 5
    years experience working as an Industrial electrician and have excellent communication skills to use to resolve technical problems, have experience
    training of team members Plan to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology and take on some further education to specialise in Network Security

The results shown above mean to me that I should be a good people person good at communicating, good problem solving skills and very wise at making decisions. I may be suited to
 work in leadership role or as team leader for example. High Emotional Intelligence people have self-awareness and assists with understanding co-workers and meeting deadlines. Are
  unbothered by criticism and remain focused on outcomes rather than becoming offended. Having a high EQ may also be better than having a High IQ as I would be a better fit for
   employment purposes or as a valuable team member.
