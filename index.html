<h2 ">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
</h2>
<p>My interest in Information Technology started back in the late 90's where I began studying a "Diploma of Computer Systems" at Boxhill Tafe. Although most of the course was quite basic I began looking for fulltime employment in the final stages of the course and I started an Electrical Apprenticeship at Ford Motor Company early 2002, whilst working through out my apprenticeship and as an Industrial Electrician I worked in IT related workplace</p>


<h2 ">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
<p>I have chosen to enrol into RMIT Bachelor of Information Technology to further my education and change careers due to covid circumstances I have had the time
to reflect on what I really want to accomplish<br> in life. Was also referred to RMIT by a family member who also works in the IT Industry.
</p>


<h2 ;">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
<p>I expect to improve my skills to a higher level in Information technology and learn to program software for use in small to large business. I would like to specialise in Networking and Security side of IT</p>

<p>This position I found interests me as I would be involved in securing the nations banks, public and private company networks and government networks. I would be involved in network security<br> at the highest level.
I realise when I see this opportunity as a requirement of 8 yrs networking experience is required and 3 years of security experience I will be required to work in the IT industry<br> for many many years to get to this elite level.
I do have 5 years experience working as an Industrial electrician and have excellent communication skills to use to resolve technical problems, have<br> experience training of team members
Plan to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology and take on some further education to specialise in Network Security as elective units where possible<br> or other online training methods.

<p>
The results shown above mean to me that I should be a good people person good at communicating, good problem solving skills and very wise at making decisions. I may be suited to work in leadership<br> role or as team leader for example. High Emotional Intelligence people have self-awareness and assists with understanding co-workers and meeting deadlines. Are unbothered by criticism and remain<br> focused on outcomes rather than becoming offended. Having a high EQ may also be better than having a High IQ as I would be a better fit for employment purposes or as a valuable team member.
