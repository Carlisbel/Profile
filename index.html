<article>
<p>My interest in Information Technology started back in the late 90's where I began studying a "Diploma of Computer Systems" at Boxhill Tafe. Although most of the
   course was quite basic I began looking for fulltime employment in the final stages of the course and I started an Electrical Apprenticeship at Ford Motor Company
    early 2002, whilst working through out my apprenticeship and as an Industrial Electrician I worked in  many IT related projects to improve maintenance of facilities,
    improving Manufacturing performance and recording of breakdowns. In my personal time I like to spend it fishing in and around victoria.

<article>
<p>I have chosen to enrol into RMIT Bachelor of Information Technology recently to further my education and change careers due to covid circumstances I have had the time
to reflect on what I really want to accomplish in life. Was also referred to RMIT by a family member who also works in the IT Industry. I am interested in working in network design
 and network security area in IT.

<p>This position I found interests me as I would be involved in securing the nations banks, public and private company networks and government networks.
   I would be involved in network security at the highest level. I realise when I see this opportunity as a requirement of 8 yrs networking experience is
    required and 3 years of security experience I will be required to work in the IT industry for many many years to get to this elite level.I do have 5
    years experience working as an Industrial electrician and have excellent communication skills to use to resolve technical problems, have experience
    training of team members Plan to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology and take on some further education to specialise in Network Security
     as elective units where possible or other
online training methods.

<p>
The results shown above mean to me that I should be a good people person good at communicating, good problem solving skills and very wise at making decisions. I may be suited to
 work in leadership role or as team leader for example. High Emotional Intelligence people have self-awareness and assists with understanding co-workers and meeting deadlines. Are
  unbothered by criticism and remain focused on outcomes rather than becoming offended. Having a high EQ may also be better than having a High IQ as I would be a better fit for
   employment purposes or as a valuable team member.

<div class="sectionContent">
<article>
  <p>After some brain storming sessions my idea for a killer "IT project idea" is to Create a <b>TOP Resume Builder Website</b> that anybody can use to create a great professional grade product
     they can use to apply for a new job or career title. I haven't found another site which has an AU domain in the top 10 links found on google.com </p>

  <div class="sectionContent">
  <article>
    <p>This is something that every day people will use, and recruitment companies won't be able to tell that the resume was created by a simple do it yourself website in five to ten minutes
      depending on how much data is entered. The document could be emailed to the individual automatically after it has been created and quickly re-attached to several emails for employers to
       view un under an hour. The format of this data could be created in a word document or PDF format or both.
