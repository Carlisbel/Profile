<article>
<p>My interest in Information Technology started back in the late 90's where I began studying a "Diploma of Computer Systems" at Boxhill Tafe. Although most of the
   course was quite basic I began looking for fulltime employment in the final stages of the course and I started an Electrical Apprenticeship at Ford Motor Company
    early 2002, whilst working through out my apprenticeship and as an Industrial Electrician I worked in  many IT related projects to improve maintenance of facilities,
    improving Manufacturing performance and recording of breakdowns. In my personal time I like to spend it fishing in and around victoria.

    required and 3 years of security experience I will be required to work in the IT industry for many many years to get to this elite level.I do have 5
    years experience working as an Industrial electrician and have excellent communication skills to use to resolve technical problems, have experience

<p>
The results shown above mean to me that I should be a good people person good at communicating, good problem solving skills and very wise at making decisions. I may be suited to
 work in leadership role or as team leader for example. High Emotional Intelligence people have self-awareness and assists with understanding co-workers and meeting deadlines. Are
  unbothered by criticism and remain focused on outcomes rather than becoming offended. Having a high EQ may also be better than having a High IQ as I would be a better fit for
   employment purposes or as a valuable team member.

<div class="sectionContent">
<article>
  <p>After some brain storming sessions my idea for a killer "IT project idea" is to create a TOP Resume Builder Website that anybody can use to create a great
     professional grade product they can use to apply for a new job or career title. I haven't found another site which has an AU domain in the top 10 links found
      on google. Using Open source resources I plan to create and develop a “Professional Resume Builder website”. </p>

  <div class="sectionContent">
  <article>
    <p>This is something that every day people will use, and recruitment companies won't be able to tell that the resume was created by a simple do it yourself
       website in five to ten minutes depending on how much data is entered. The document could be emailed to the individual automatically after it has been created
        and quickly re-attached to several emails for employers to view in under an hour. The format of this data could be created in a word document or PDF format
         or possibly both.

    <article>
<p>Currently there is a massive shortage of workers applying for jobs in many industries affected by COVID-19 recently such as Medical professionals, aviation,
   Retail, hospitality and tourism sectors. Being able to create a new resume readily and easily will get people back into the workforce faster. People like to use
    technology to make life easier having access to this website from their personal mobile devices will save time and make job hunting more efficient.

        <li>Optionally this last part can be added to the website to create an income for each resume created, "Create an account", "email and password", "Request for payment
           screen" to be subscribed to, to receive and download your resume. A subscription can be cancelled if not required after 14 business days so only a one time payment would
            be required in this case. When the subscription expires or cancels in 14 business days the data can then be automatically wiped from the database so it does not always
